# 🚀 MLflow Integration Successfully Added to FLUE!

Congratulations! I've successfully integrated MLflow experiment tracking into your FLUE benchmark, specifically for the `cls-books-HF` task.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified:

### ✅ New Files:
1. **`flue/train_with_mlflow.py`** - MLflow wrapper for Hugging Face training
2. **`start_mlflow_ui.sh`** - Script to easily launch MLflow UI
3. **`MLFLOW_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
4. **`test_mlflow_integration.py`** - Test script (can be deleted after testing)

### ✅ Modified Files:
1. **`flue/evaluation_auto.sh`** - Updated `cls-books-HF` task with MLflow integration

## 🎯 How to Use:

### 1. Run a Training Experiment with MLflow:
```bash
# Navigate to FLUE directory
cd FLUE

# Run with MLflow tracking (installs MLflow automatically)
./flue/evaluation_auto.sh cls-books-HF true flaubert_base_cased

# Or with a custom configuration
./flue/evaluation_auto.sh cls-books-HF true camembert_base my_custom_config.cfg
```

### 2. View Results in MLflow UI:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the convenient script
./start_mlflow_ui.sh

# Option 2: Manual command
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlflow_logs --port 5000
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000** in your browser

## 🎉 What's Tracked Automatically:

### 📊 **Metrics:**
- Training loss per epoch
- Validation accuracy & loss
- Final test accuracy
- All evaluation metrics

### ⚙️ **Parameters:**
- Model name (e.g., flaubert_base_cased)
- Learning rate
- Number of epochs
- Batch size
- Max sequence length
- Task name

### 📦 **Artifacts:**
- Complete trained model
- Model configuration files
- Tokenizer files
- Training logs
- Prediction files
- Evaluation results

## 🔥 Key Benefits:

1. **🔍 Experiment Comparison** - Compare different models and hyperparameters side-by-side
2. **📈 Metric Visualization** - Interactive plots of training progress
3. **🔄 Reproducibility** - Complete experiment configuration saved
4. **📁 Model Management** - Easy access to trained models and artifacts
5. **🏆 Best Model Tracking** - Identify your best performing experiments

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Run your first experiment** with the modified script
2. **Launch MLflow UI** to see the results
3. **Compare different models** by running multiple experiments
4. **Extend to other tasks** (I can help integrate MLflow into other FLUE tasks like `xnli-HF`)

## 💡 Example Workflow:

```bash
# Compare different models
./flue/evaluation_auto.sh cls-books-HF true flaubert_base_cased
./flue/evaluation_auto.sh cls-books-HF true camembert_base  
./flue/evaluation_auto.sh cls-books-HF true distilbert-base-multilingual-cased

# Launch UI to compare results
./start_mlflow_ui.sh
```

The integration is fully backwards compatible - your existing scripts will work exactly the same, but now with powerful experiment tracking capabilities!

Would you like me to help you:
1. Run your first MLflow-tracked experiment?
2. Extend the integration to other FLUE tasks?
3. Customize the tracking for specific metrics you care about?
